## DS 4420 Final Project

Final Project for my Data Mining & Machine Learning II class analyzing a publicly available dataset on mass shootings over the course of several decades. The project is split up into several different tasks and each is tackled as a Classification or Regression problem. The appropriate models are built and run, and then performance is reported through several different metrics. Full report available within the repository
