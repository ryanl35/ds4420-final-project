# DS 4420 Final Project

Final Project for my Data Mining & Machine Learning II class analyzing a publicly available dataset (available here: https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years?select=Mass+Shootings+Dataset+Ver+5.csv) on mass shootings over the course of several decades. The project is split up into several different tasks and each is tackled as a Classification or Regression problem. The appropriate models are built and run, and then performance is reported through several different metrics. Full report available within the repository.

## Different Models Used:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- kNN
- SVM
- Linear Regression
